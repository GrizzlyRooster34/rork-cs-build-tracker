# Contributing to CS Build Tracker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CS Build Tracker! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cs-build-tracker.git
   cd cs-build-tracker
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and focused

### File Structure

- Place reusable components in `/components`
- Store types in `/types/index.ts`
- Create new stores in `/store` for state management
- Add utilities in `/utils`
- Follow Expo Router conventions for pages in `/app`

### State Management

- Use Zustand for complex state management
- Persist data with AsyncStorage when appropriate
- Keep stores focused on specific domains
- Use TypeScript interfaces for store state

### Mobile-First Development

- Design for mobile screens first
- Test on both iOS and Android
- Ensure web compatibility (avoid mobile-only APIs)
- Use responsive design principles
- Consider one-handed usage patterns

### Testing

- Test on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
- Verify data persistence works correctly
- Test edge cases (empty states, large datasets)
- Ensure proper error handling

## Contribution Types

### Bug Fixes

1. Check if the issue already exists in GitHub Issues
2. Create a new issue if it doesn't exist
3. Reference the issue number in your commit message
4. Include steps to reproduce the bug
5. Test your fix thoroughly

### New Features

1. Discuss the feature in GitHub Issues first
2. Ensure it fits the app's purpose (VW Passat B6 project tracking)
3. Follow the existing UI/UX patterns
4. Add appropriate TypeScript types
5. Update documentation if needed

### Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update type definitions
- Include examples in documentation

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add or update tests if applicable
4. Ensure all existing tests pass
5. Create a clear pull request description:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were necessary
   - How to test the changes
   - Screenshots for UI changes
